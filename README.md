# Sales Volume Prediction: A Data Science Approach


# Overview:

This project focuses on predicting daily sales volume in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry. The goal is to build a robust forecasting model that considers external factors such as weather conditions and holidays to optimize inventory management and improve operational efficiency. The project involves extensive data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.

# Dataset:

Source: data volume.csv

Index: Date

Features: Various external factors affecting sales volume, including:

Historical sales data

Weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.)

Holiday information

# Data Import & Preprocessing:

Reads the dataset using pandas

Parses the date column as an index

Checks for missing values and outliers

Handles missing values using appropriate imputation techniques

Data normalization and scaling

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Summary statistics and correlation analysis

Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn

Time-series decomposition to analyze trends and seasonality

Identification of patterns affecting volume predictions

# Feature Engineering:

Handling categorical and numerical variables

Creating new relevant features (e.g., lag features, rolling averages, moving averages)

Encoding categorical variables

Dimensionality reduction techniques if necessary

# Modeling:

Selection of suitable machine learning models, including:

Time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, etc.)

Deep Lerning Models (RNN based LSTM, CNN, GRU)

Model training and hyperparameter tuning

Cross-validation and performance evaluation using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R-squared

# Results & Insights:

Comparison of model performances

Business implications of predictions

Interpretation of key influencing factors

Recommendations for inventory management and sales strategies

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, prophet, tensorflow 

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Git

Machine Learning Models: Various regression and time-series forecasting techniques
